- Provided a quick overview of the application's data

## Development Approach

The implementation followed an incremental approach, with each step building on the previous one:

1. **Start with Core Functionality**: The project began with basic product management to establish the foundation.

2. **Refactor Early**: The architecture was refactored early to ensure a clean separation of concerns before adding more features.

3. **Add Features Incrementally**: New features (recipes, carts) were added one by one, with each step fully tested before moving on.

4. **Enhance User Experience**: Later commits focused on improving error handling, validation, and documentation.

5. **Add Operational Features**: The final steps added monitoring, health checks, and statistics to improve operational visibility.

This approach allowed for a controlled development process with clear milestones and ensured that the application was always in a working state. Each feature was fully implemented and tested before moving on to the next, reducing the risk of regression issues.

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Hexagonal Architecture**: The application uses a hexagonal architecture with clean separation between domain, application, and infrastructure layers.

2. **Domain-Driven Design**: The domain model is kept pure and free from infrastructure concerns, with mappers translating between domain and infrastructure entities.

3. **Repository Pattern**: Repositories provide a clean interface for data access, hiding the details of the underlying storage.

4. **DTO Pattern**: Data Transfer Objects are used to transfer data between layers and to the client, avoiding exposing domain models directly.

5. **Dependency Injection**: Spring's dependency injection is used to manage dependencies and promote loose coupling.

These architectural decisions have resulted in a clean, maintainable codebase that can be easily extended with new features in the future.
